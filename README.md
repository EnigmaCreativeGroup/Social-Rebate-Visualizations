Data Visualization for Social Rebate
This repository includes source code for the data visualization, using these images

as a mockup for the final result. Currently planned visualizations for the data are in the form of a bar, circle, and line graph. Some proof of concept visualizations are located in the examples directory and are used for reference.

EXPERIMENTAL: If all goes well, we can attempt an experimental data visualization using an integration between d3 and three.js; however this will be marked as unstable due to the facilities of the web browser being limited with 3D graphics
